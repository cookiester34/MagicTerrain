This is my latest implementation of Marching cubes to create planets procedurally.

I've decided to archive it and make public as I don't have much time to work on it anymore.
This repo contains 3 versions of it, my first attempt, 2nd attempt with better organised cleaner code, and my last attempt called TerrainBakery the cleanest of the 3 versions, including code for a character controller and gravity of the planets.

If this code helps anyone feel free to use it, my hope is to return to marching cubes with better knowledge and finish creating procedural planets with caves, water, mountains all that good stuff.
I will probably use compute shaders next time attempting this as it will be faster than using the Jobs system.
