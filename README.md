This is my latest implementation of Marching cubes to create planets procedurally.

I've decided to archive it and make public as I don't have much time to work on it anymore, it is still very much a work in progress and I would love to continue to work on it I have some ideas of how to solve gaps between Lods and improve performance.

This repo contains 3 iterations of marching cubes I like to keep the old versions to compare against, version 3 the cleanest of the 3 versions also including code for a character controller and gravity of the planets.

If this code helps anyone feel free to use it, my hope is to return to marching cubes with better knowledge and finish creating procedural planets with caves, water, mountains all that good stuff.
I will probably use compute shaders next time attempting this as it will be faster than using the Jobs system.
